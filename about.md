Hi, I am Manju. You can follow my adventures in programming on this blog.
I set this blog up using Jekyll and host it on Github Pages. 
When I am not programming, I am hiking or making plans to go hiking.

You can also follow me on Twitter [https://twitter.com/vmanju]

You can **download** the Jekyll theme I have used from here:
